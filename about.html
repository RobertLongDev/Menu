        <p>Where? Where did this restaurant come from? Where did the owner get it? I'm making a site for it, there are reviews for it, real world people say they've been to it and that it has great food and atmosphere. But no one, and I mean <strong>no one</strong> has told me <em>where</em> they went to get to it. What road they took, where they parked, how long they walked to reach the door. I'm starting to think that no one <em>can</em> tell me. No one seems to know which location was the first, or what areas the other stores expanded into. But there have to be at least 4 buildings, since people have ate at the same time and not seen each other and decribed different layouts. Unless that has something to do with the Redesign... In any case, these stores just seem to... exist... some <em>where</em>. And people just find it when they feel like they want something to eat. No matter where they are, no matter when that is. They'll all manage to show up during the open hours, with enough time to finish their meal comfortably before the doors close for the day. How? I'll have to ask the owner the next time i see... Wait, did I ever even meet the owner?</p>
